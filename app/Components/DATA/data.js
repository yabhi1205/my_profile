This innovative web portal empowers users to take control of their garbage pickup schedules, eliminating the traditional dependency on the garbage truck driver's reporting time. By developing this system using cutting-edge technologies like React.js, Sass, Node.js, MongoDB, and integrating the TomTom Map API, I revolutionized waste management. Users now experience enhanced convenience, reduced waiting times, and improved resource utilization. Furthermore, the integration of a chatbot within the Next.js web app achieved a remarkable 60% query resolution efficiency, streamlining communication with the query department when required.`,
